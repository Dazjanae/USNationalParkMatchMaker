<h2>Project Title</h2>
US National Park Match Maker

<h2>Description</h2>
This is an application which allows a user to select the desired region they wish to visit a US National Park. For this project, HTML was used to add needed content and details for the viewer, a tad of CSS was used in order to add order to the flow of the page, and Javascript was used to randomize park options based on the region that the user input. In the future, I wish to add more CSS to the page for bettere visual appeal. I also plan on updating the Javascript to add questions and match user's answers with the best park, opposed to it being randomized.
